# No Rep Left Behind

This is a UI (User Interface)-only modification to *Mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries*. 

This mod disables the 'ACCEPT' button on the Negotiation screen until:

* The player is out of Negotiation Points, or
* Every category of benefit that can be negotiated is maximized.


The disabled button is grey and does not respond to clicks; the enabled button is white (and functions).

User feedback is very welcome via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sapphon/NoRepLeftBehind/issues).
